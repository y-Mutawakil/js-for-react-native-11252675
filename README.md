Task 1: In arrayManipulation.js, you're asked to create a function named processArray that manipulates an array of numbers. It squares even numbers and triples odd numbers, returning a new array with these modifications.

Task 2: Extend arrayManipulation.js with a function called formatArrayStrings. This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by processArray. It then modifies each string based on its corresponding number. If the number is even, the string is capitalized; if odd, it's converted to lowercase.

Task 3: Create a new file named userInfo.js. Write a function called createUserProfiles which takes two arrays as arguments: an array of original names and an array of modified names from Task 2. The function returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and an id which auto-increments starting from 1.

Task 4: Created Readme File.
